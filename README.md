## References

### References used (besides JavaDoc and course materials): 
None. I took inspiration from what I already know of how lists work though.

### If you used AI at all for this assignment: How did you use it? What did this experience teach you? 
I did not use AI.

## Reflection Questions

### What was your overall experience with this assignment? What was hardest? What was easiest?
Overall pretty positive I think, it was nice to work on once I got into the flow of it. I think the hardest was deciding what methods I wanted to create, and how I wanted my list to behave. Easiest was probably javadoc comments.

### What was your hardest ListADT design decision, and why?
getSublist, purely because of how many tests I had to create. I think it will be a harder thing to implement as well. It is just so complex comparatively that it was harder to know if I got all of the edge cases and that the actual use of it made sense.

### What assumptions did you make while designing ListADT?
I am assuming that the list will not have items in it that randomly appear or disappear. I am assuming that there is an order to the elements in the list. I am assuming that we will have the ability to access the elements of the list. I also assumed that the list can have multiple of the same element (2 can show up multiple times for example.). A few more assumptions I made were that indexing starts at 0, and that a list can be empty.
